<p><font face="Arial" size="4">How to reflect arcs in Graffiti Grapher:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">
<img border="0" src="img/X_reflect.jpg" align="right" width="216" height="287"></font></p>
<font SIZE="4"> 
<p><font face="Arial">Lets start with the two lines of the single default shape 
  you get when you first open the applet. </font><font face="Arial">We turn shape 
  1 border 2 into an arc, and set &quot;after each degree swept&quot; to 0 to 
  avoid confusion about changing the radius. No</font><font face="Arial">w we 
  have the default values radius 60, starting angle 40, ending angle 80. Now click 
  on shape 1 border 1. Note that you again have to make the radius 60 and &quot;after 
  each degree swept&quot; to 0. Now if you make both angles negative (sa= -40, 
  ea = -80) then you have reflected across the X axis. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Reflection across the Y axis is a little more tricky. First, 
  take away the negative signs so we are back to the default values. Now, I think 
  about it this way: the Y axis is at 90 degrees. So you want to do the same thing 
  on both sides of the 90 degree angle. The starting angle sa=40 will &quot;undershoot&quot; 
  90 by fifty degrees. So on the other side of the Y axis, you want ea to &quot;overshoot&quot; 
  <img border="0" src="img/Y_reflect.jpg" align="left" width="220" height="203">90 
  by fifty degrees. Thus ea = (50 + 90) = </font><font size="4"><font face="Arial">140 
  </font></font><font face="Arial">. Same with ending angle ea=80: it will &quot;undershoot&quot; 
  90 by ten degrees on the right side, so you want sa to &quot;overshoot&quot; 
  90 by 10 degrees on the left side: 10+90 = 100. Thus ea = 140, sa = 100.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font face="Arial">Now lets look at all four quadrants. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">The sa=40 of the first arc is similar to sa=140 of the second 
  arc because when we reflect the grid around the y axis, the 0 is like the 180. 
  But after reflection you can see that red arrow <img border="0" src="img/4quad.jpg" align="right" width="528" height="522">which 
  was going counterclockwise before is going clockwise now.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">As a result as we go up in numbers from 0 to 40 for the 
  original arc, it's like going down in numbers from the 180 to 140 in the reflected 
  arc. Since the sa of 40 was saying that we started the arc 40 degrees away from 
  the 0, we take 40 degrees away from the 180 and get 140. Similarly the 80 becomes 
  100 because 180-80=100.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">This way we are reflecting both the angles and the direction 
  of the arcs which are drawn as red arrows, from the start of the arc to the 
  end of the arc.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">Now let's say we want to reflect across the x axis instead 
  of the y axis. We start by going counterclockwise in a positive direction. After 
  reflecting we will be going clockwise, in a negative direction again. So the 
  0 is like 360. The 40 is like 360-40=320, and the 80 is like 360-80=280.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">And finally to reflect across both the x and the y axis 
  we can take our first reflection across the y axis and reflect it now across 
  the x axis, now we are going counterclockwise again from 180 to 270, thus the 
  angles are </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial">220 and 260.</font></p>
