Kids will be able to measure their neighborhood and will learn generative justice in the class by comparing how prosperous their neighborhood is. Other primary goal is to make it useful for teachers teaching kids. We will be making our system as eClassroom where teachers and students will be able to login and teachers will be able to see what tags kids have added. <p></p> </div><!--//content--> </div><!--//section-inner--> </section> </div> <div class="row"> <section class="about section"> <div class="section-inner"> <h2 class="heading">Users of the System</h2> <div class="content"> Anyone who wants to compare his neighborhood in the state of New York will be able to use this application to add his own custom tags. It is also helpful for teachers teaching kids about generative justice. Additionally, kids will be able to compare neighborhood in the class by looking at the interactive charts corresponding to their neighborhood. <p></p> </div><!--//content--> </div><!--//section-inner--> </section> </div> <div class="row"> <section class="about section"> <div class="section-inner"> <h2 class="heading">Developers GitHub Link</h2> <div class="content"> <p>Front-End Developer: Gouravjeet Singh : <a href="https://github.com/gouravjeet/SGIS-2.0">https://github.com/gouravjeet/SGIS-2.0</a> <br></p> <p>Back-End Developer: Kathleen Tully : <a href="https://github.com/kathleentully/gis_csdt">https://github.com/kathleentully/gis_csdt</a> <br></p> <h5>Note: Installation guide is provided on Github</h5> </div> </div></section> </div> <div class="row"> <section class="about section"> <div class="section-inner"> <h2 class="heading">Licence</h2> <div class="content"> Copyright (c) 2014, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute All rights reserved.
