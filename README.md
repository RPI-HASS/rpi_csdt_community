This project is sponsored by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's GK-12 fellowship under Dr. Ron Eglash. The goal is to create a web platform for students to share projects, community, and create a community in general around the pCSDT's. More information about the pCSDT's (also serving as a demo) can be found [on our website](https://csdt.rpi.edu/)
