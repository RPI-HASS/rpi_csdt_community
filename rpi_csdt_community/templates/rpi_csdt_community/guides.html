              Congratulations on finishing all of the CSDT modules! Taking the time to explore and create designs on our modules introduces you to programming and the art of composing code. We hope it starts a love of programming in you! The good news is that CSDT is just the beginning on your coding journey! There are a ton of careers you can pursue as a computer programmer. For example, computer scientists study the science and logic behind coding, web programmers create interactive web sites for businesses and organizations, software engineers create programs that permit workers to work more efficiently, data scientists study the volumes of data create by the internet and try and use it for better software, info security professionals study cryptography to permit secrecy and privacy on the internet and computers, artificial intelligence scientists attempt to create software that can program software itself, network architects build the infrastructure necessary to permit wireless networks in buildings and businesses as well as cell phones, database administrators control the databases that let businesses save information about orders, computer engineers study electrical engineering to make the next iteration of silicon chip processors that power computers, and IT professionals work in businesses to make sure everything related to computers and the network is operating smoothly. There are a tons of careers to pursue in computer science! Our suggestion is to dive in and start reading books on programming and find what you love to study! Learning to program will do you a service in any STEAM career! Many biologists need to learn how to program to do their job, for example. Crunching data in python helps scientists in astronomy analyze galaxies. There are tons of possibilities that come about from learning how to program!

            <p>
              Let's start by introducing ourselves to the current world of programming. The most popular programming languages at the moment are: C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, CSS & HTML, Ruby, PHP, C, C#, and Swift. If you were to go into a public library, for example, these are the languages on which they would have books. There are many other programming languages, however, and each serve a niche purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's say that you wanted to learn JavaScript. You could first go to the public library and check out any book they have on JavaScript (they are bound to have a few). Try and get the most recent book. Read the entire book front to back, retyping the code into an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDE</a> like <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> and answering any questions or programming exercises they have at the end of each chapter. Remember, the first time studying a programming language will be very difficult because every concept is new. But once you know what a constructor is, you know what a constructor is in any language! Always be sure to do every programming exercise at the end of each chapter. Being able to code a small program from scratch is what teaches you how to code and write programs. Be sure not to skip out on the programming exercises! They take a long time to do, but all that time put into coding is what will make you a great coder!
            </p>
              Let's say you've exhausted the JavaScript programming books at your public library. The next thing to do is turn to the internet. There are many good tutorials and books on JavaScript that are free on the internet. For example, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming">Khan Academy</a> has a few tutorials on programming JavaScript and HTML/CSS. Do all of those! The next thing to do is look to <a href="http://video.google.com">YouTube</a>. Search for "JavaScript tutorial", "JavaScript for beginners", and so forth. The quality of these videos can vary drastically, but what you are looking for is a long series of videos that covers all aspects of JavaScript programming, from beginners stuff to advanced stuff. A good tip is to search for "Best JavaScript YouTube tutorials" in google for articles about the best of the best. If you are just looking for advanced stuff, "Advanced javascript" is a good youtube search term too. Many of these videos are playlists of 20+ videos, so be sure to go to "playlist" under the creator's youtube page and queue up the series. Watch as many of these series as you can until you feel you very much have the basics down.
            </p>
              Next, you may want to look for more advanced JavaScript books. A good resource is the <a href="https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md">list on github of all free computer programming books.</a> If you go to the JavaScript section, for example, there are many good and updated books on JavaScript. Read through these and do the programming exercises at the end of each chapter. You'll soon be very proficient at JavaScript and you'll be ready to do more advanced stuff.
            <p>
              Now that you've exhausted all the JavaScript books from your local public library, watched most of the tutorial series on YouTube, and read as many good JavaScript books as you could from <a href="https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md">this list on github</a>, you are left with some options. Do you want to learn more advanced JavaScript, like frameworks (React, Angular4, Vue.js, Ember, Elm, Node.js), or do you want to learn another computer language? If you want to learn frameworks, a good tactic is to first search YouTube for tutorials and do all of them. Then see what is available on the MOOCs by searching <a href="http://www.class-central.com">Class-Central.com</a> for the framework you are looking for. MOOCs are free online classes that usually teach programming lessons through videos and reading. Example of MOOC platforms include <a href="http://www.edx.org">EdX</a>, <a href="http://www.coursera.com">Coursera</a>, <a href="http://www.udacity.com">Udacity</a>, <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/">MIT OCW</a>, and <a href="https://www.apple.com/education/itunes-u/">iTunes U</a>. These classes are typically more geared towards computer science classes, but you might get lucky and find a javascript framework class on there. Otherwise you might have to rely on non-free services, like <a href="http://www.lynda.com">Lynda</a> or <a href="http://www.teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a>. Perhaps your public library subscribes to one or both of these services? If not, you could ask them to.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's say, for example, that you are really happy with JavaScript and you think you want to keep up with front-end/full-stack developing. One thing you can do is search YouTube for FullStack Developer guides, such a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBzRwzY7G-k">this video</a>. Write down all the programming languages listed in the video (Node.js, Ruby, PHP, Elixir, Scala, Clojure, Haskell, Go, Rust, C#, Java, MongoDB, Sass, React, Angular, Ember, Vue.js, ClojureScript, Elm). You can start by searching google or YouTube for tutorials on each of these. Big backend programming languages like Ruby, PHP, Elixir, Scala, Clojure, Haskell, Go, Rust, C#, and Java will have <a href="https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md">free books</a> written for each of them, while the smaller programming languages like the new javascript frameworks may have to be learned through YouTube tutorials. The goal here is to know what resources are available for learning programming for free, and knowing what to search google for to turn up those resources. The more knowledgeable and skilled you become about finding resources to study computer science online, the faster you'll be able to learn languages for free.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now let's say you want to study computer science and learn about programming in general. There are many resources you can use in studying it for free online. One such resource is <a href="http://blog.agupieware.com/2014/06/online-learning-intensive-bachelors.html">this blog post from GupieWare</a> that distills an entire bachelors degree in computer science into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCourseWare">OpenCourseWare</a> YouTube playlists. This post is also helpful because it demonstrates the usually course trajectory of a bachelors degree in computer science. You start with introductory classes, then you study algorithms and datastructures, discrete mathematics, and so forth. Once you know what classes you need to take, you can use google or <a href="http://class-central.com">class-central.com</a> to search specifically for that class topic. There are things called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources">Open Educational Resources</a> that are basically free textbooks for computer science classes, like data structures, databases, or operating systems. One example of this is <a href="https://learn.saylor.org/course/index.php?categoryid=9">Saylor University</a>, which has an entire curriculum of computer science texts for free online at their website. This is a good, free way to study the core computer science curriculum. In fact, it's the OER that <a href="http://www.uopeople.edu/">University of the People</a> use for their $4000 online bachelors of science in computer science. OER is very helpful if you are studying computer science online through OpenCourseWare.

              Another thing you can do after you are skilled enough at programming is to try and get an internship. CS Internships usually pay about $15/hour for 20 hours a week. That way you can work and gain experience while also being committed to studying programming in your free time. Just be honest during your interview about your skill level and be willing to negotiate for a job with reduced pay, for example, if you're still just learning the ropes. What you are looking for is institutional support where a boss will guide you about what to study next in programming in return for small projects for the company. Your internship will be a great place to learn more languages, as often you develop in brand new stacks that you aren't familiar with and you have to throw everything you have at it to learn it in about 2 weeks. Any commitment put into studying CS before your internship will pay off when you are tasked with learning a new programming language in a few weeks. Almost all jobs will be using stacks and languages that you aren't familiar with, and a common interview question is how long it takes for you to learn a new programming language. You want to be able to give anecdotal evidence about your internship wherein you learned Angular4 and were up and coding, for example, in three weeks. That you are able to do this shows that you have a thorough grasp of CS fundamentals, and that learning a new language is just a matter of getting used to new syntax. An internship can also help you out because your employer may sign you up for professional development sites like <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/">PluralSight</a> which you can then study other languages in your free time using your employee account. Internships (and the concomitant experience on your resume) are very important, and the earlier you can get one the sooner you'll learn what being a programmer means and requires. Your boss will help you develop as a programmer, giving you tasks for your specific skill level (but always challenging you). And your employer might even pay for some of your tuition costs if you are going to a community college or a cheap online program like <a href="http://www.uopeople.edu">UoPeople</a>. You can even negotiate, trading a paid internship for an unpaid internship if there are enough employee benefits like professional development sites or tuition reimbursements. Look around at the local companies that employ programmers and learn about them, then ask for an interview for an internship. Only ask for a paid internship if you are familiar with the stack they are using. Otherwise, do an unpaid or minimum wage internship where the reward is learning their stack. Good luck!
            </p>
            <p>
              A new experiment you can undertake is to sign up at your local <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace">makerspace</a>. Many cities now have makerspaces, and if you are studying online, they can often replace the social setting that a physical classroom entails. You can go there and study on your computer and at the same time talk with other people interested in STEAM. It is kind of like a library, in that sense. There will most likely be other people there that know how to code, and they can help guide you in the direction your studies should take. They can recommend books or tutorials, and help you when you are stuck. Makerspaces are expensive ($60/month), but they give you 24/7 access, a nice place to study, and a community of like-minded STEAM people. That might be worth it to you.

              If you don't have a laptop, a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> is invaluable in your quest to become a computer scientist. The simple fact is you are going to have to learn linux if you want to be a developer, and the Raspberry Pi is a cheap beginner's resource for learning linux (although we alternatively also recommend installing debian or ubuntu on an old unused PC or laptop). The Raspberry Pi is a no-risk computer that you can experiment without harming your parent's personal property (by formatting the harddrive when you shouldn't, for example). It's a great way to familiarize yourself with the command line and linux. Have a bake sale or a lemonade stand to raise money for a Raspberry Pi! Then you'll have a dedicated personal desktop to learn python, java, ruby, javascript, c++, linux, etc. <a href="https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md#linux">There are many OER linux books</a> and your public library or local college library is sure to have a few more.
