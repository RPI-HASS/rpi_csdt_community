      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        Culturally Situated Design Tools is a project led by <a href="http://www.sts.rpi.edu/pl/faculty/ron-eglash">Dr. Ron Eglash</a>, professor of Science and Technology Studies at <a href="http://rpi.edu/">Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute</a>. Professor Eglash led a 2007 TED talk entitled <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/ron_eglash_on_african_fractals">"The fractals at the heart of African designs"</a>, about fractal design and patterns in African art, architecture, religion, and culture. CSDT is an application of that research, combining ethnomathematics and ethnocomputing into K-12 online EdTech dedicated to teach students programming exclusively through cultural lessons. There are many sites out there where you can learn how to program, but CSDT is one of the few that does it through reading multicultural lessons about heritage algorithms, cultural computational thinking, and indigineous mathematics. Our aim is to inculcate programming and computer science to be an active academic interest to African American, Native American, and Latino students.

        Many people have contributed to CSDT over the years, including undergraduate and graduate students at RPI. We are currently funded by NSF grant <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1640014&HistoricalAwards=false">#1640014</a>.
